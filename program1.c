// . A tridiagonal array a is an n-by-n array in which a[i][j]==0, if absolute value of i-j is 
// greater than 1. What is the maximum number of nonzero elements in such an array? 
// How can these elements be stored sequentially in memory? Develop an algorithm for 
// accessing a[i][j] if the absolute value of i-j is 1 or less. Do the same for an array a in 
// which a[i][j] == 0, if the absolute value of i-j is greater than k.
